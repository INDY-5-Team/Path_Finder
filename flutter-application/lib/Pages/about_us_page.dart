              'The CHOA Map Application is a mobile app designed to help patients, families, and visitors navigate through the Children\'s Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) hospital using checkpoints. The inspiration for this project came from our lead documentation and algorithms engineer, Zach, whose mother works at CHOA. She noticed how confusing the layout of the new hospital additions could be, and Zach decided to find a solution.\n'
              'Zach brought the rest of the team together to develop this mobile application, aiming to improve the experience of navigating the hospital. Initially, the idea was to use QR-code checkpoints for patients once they checked in, with a simple database to verify information and authorization. This would allow users to receive an ID linked to a specific room, enabling navigation through the hospital using different methods, such as QR-codes, GPS, or a roadmap\n.'
              'However, due to CHOA\'s security and privacy policies, we had to adjust our plan. The current version of the CHOA Map Application is a beta that keeps the core idea intact, though all data is mocked for demonstration purposes. We are excited to present this version to you and continue our journey in developing a helpful tool for hospital visitors.',
