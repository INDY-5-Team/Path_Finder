## Features

- **Node-based Map Traversal**: Users can traverse the map using predefined nodes and paths. Each node represents a significant point or location on the map.
- **Point-to-Point Navigation**: Users can select a starting node and an end node to traverse the shortest or specified path between them.
- **QR Code Checkpoints**: At each node, users will scan a QR code to confirm their location and proceed to the next checkpoint.
- **Dynamic Path Visualization**: The path between nodes is dynamically generated, providing visual guidance to the next destination.
- **Simple, Intuitive Interface**: Easy-to-use interface that guides users from one node to the next with real-time feedback on their progress.

## Usage

1. Open the app on your device or emulator.
2. Follow menu to map directory
3. Select a starting node and destination node from the list or map.
4. Follow the generated path between nodes.
5. When you reach a node, scan the QR code checkpoint to verify your location.
6. Continue traversing the nodes until you reach your final destination.
7. The app will guide you along the way with real-time updates and visual aids.

## QR Code Checkpoints

-QR code checkpoints are used for path finder when the user is unsure of their current location
-QR codes can be placed around the building in key areas and allow users to orient themselves on the map
